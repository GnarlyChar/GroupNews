# What is a cook group?

A cook group is an online community that provides valuable tools, tips, and resources to help members secure high-demand items like Pokémon packs, GPUs, sneakers, and collectibles. These groups, typically hosted on Discord, offer insider knowledge, restock alerts, and automation tools to improve your chances of copping limited-edition products. The most effective ones usually require a monthly subscription. Whether you're a collector or reseller, joining a cook group can be an essential tool for staying ahead and securing the most sought-after items.
