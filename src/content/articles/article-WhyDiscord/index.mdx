# Why Discord is Important for Reselling & Bots
Discord is the central hub for the reselling and botting community, providing a real-time communication platform where users can share information, buy and sell tools, and stay updated on profitable opportunities. Unlike traditional forums or social media, Discord offers private, invite-only servers where resellers can access exclusive cook groups, bot marketplaces, monitors, and insider knowledge that aren't available to the general public.

For botting and automation, Discord is essential because most bots require Discord authentication to use them. Developers also provide updates, troubleshooting, and guides directly through official bot servers. Additionally, cook groups—private communities that provide real-time alerts on restocks, price errors, and deal opportunities—operate almost entirely through Discord. These groups use advanced monitoring tools that notify users instantly when high-demand products become available.

Marketplaces like Tidal and Bot Mart also rely on Discord for buying and selling bot licenses, memberships, and digital goods. Transactions in these servers are safer due to middleman services and verified sellers, making Discord the most trusted platform for resellers. Whether you're looking to join a cook group, buy a bot, or get insider reselling knowledge, Discord is where it all happens.
