# Why Proxies Are Used in Botting & Different Types

## Why Proxies Are Used in Botting:

Proxies are essential for botting because they mask the bot operator's real IP address, preventing bans and allowing multiple purchase attempts on limited-stock items. Many websites have anti-bot measures that detect and block IP addresses showing bot-like behavior, such as sending too many requests. Proxies help bypass these restrictions by distributing requests across multiple IPs, making them appear as separate real users.
Types of Proxies for Botting:

1.	Residential Proxies – These are IP addresses assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to real users. They provide high legitimacy, making them harder to detect and ban. However, they can be expensive and sometimes slower than other proxy types.
2.	Data Center Proxies – These originate from data centers rather than ISPs. They are fast and inexpensive but easily detectable by websites, making them less ideal for sneaker botting.
3.	ISP Proxies – A hybrid between residential and data center proxies, ISP proxies are hosted in data centers but provided by ISPs. They offer both high speed and legitimacy, making them the best choice for sneaker botting.
4.	Proxy Pools – Instead of using a single proxy, a pool rotates multiple proxies to distribute requests and avoid detection. This helps prevent bans and ensures continuous operation.

## Why ISP Proxies Are Ideal for Sneaker Botting:

*	Mimic Real Users: Since ISP proxies come from real ISPs like Verizon or Comcast, they are harder to detect and ban.
*	Bypass Purchase Limits: They allow multiple purchases by making each request appear as a separate user.
*	Enhanced Security: Protects personal information and prevents IP tracking.
*	Faster Performance: Optimized for speed, ensuring quicker responses when sneaker drops go live.
*	Geo-Bypassing: Enables access to location-restricted sneaker releases.

Using proxies, particularly ISP proxies, ensures higher success rates in sneaker botting while reducing the chances of getting blocked or flagged.
