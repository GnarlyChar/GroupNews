Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from their outer scope. This article explains closures, their practical uses, and common pitfalls.

## What Are Closures?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state.

```js
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
        console.log(`Outer Variable: ${outerVariable}`);
        console.log(`Inner Variable: ${innerVariable}`);
    };
}

const closureExample = outerFunction("I am from outerFunction");

// Calling the inner function with the closure
closureExample("I am from innerFunction");

```
