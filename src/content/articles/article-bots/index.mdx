# Bots

A bot in the reselling world is an automated software program designed to secure high-demand items faster than a human could manually. These bots track product drops, instantly fill in payment and shipping details, and complete checkouts within seconds. Many can run multiple tasks simultaneously, increasing the chances of success. Some bots, known as All-in-One (AIO) bots, support multiple retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Shopify, while others focus on specific platforms, such as ticket or sneaker reselling. While bots give resellers a significant edge in acquiring limited-edition products like sneakers, gaming consoles, graphics cards, and collectibles, there are still many different things like proxies, servers, and bot settings. Bots are a powerful tool for resellers looking to maximize profits in competitive markets.
